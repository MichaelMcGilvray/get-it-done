0 - Windows Install

This step is extremely easy.

First grab the precompiled binary of SQLite from this link:
https://www.sqlite.org/2022/sqlite-dll-win64-x64-3380200.zip

If you're on Linux you can very likely get SQLite from your repository, check for availability.

If you're a different operating system choose your correct implementation:

Rest of the guide is Windows, good luck if you're otherwise. (I don't own a Mac, can't help there.)

Go to your main windows drive. This is likely C:\

Find the Windows folder. From there navigate to System32. (Be not afraid.)

Drag the SQLite .dll and .def files into your System32 folder.

Now sqlite3 is an integral part of your Windows operating system! It sounds scary on paper, but try it out!

Open a command prompt and run `sqlite3`.

If you see this `sqlite>` you've executed all previous steps successfully!

You can exit this by typing `.exit` or just closing the terminal.

You are now one step closer to using SQLite for database management!
